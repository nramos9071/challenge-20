                I am Nicholas Ramos and i am a full stack developer. I got my bachelor's degree
                from Texas A&M University - San Antonio in History and i am currently enrolled in 
                the coding bootcamp at University of Texas - Austin. I decided to get into coding 
                due to having a fascination with technology at a young age. This fascination has drove 
                me to learn more about coding and how to build websites.
